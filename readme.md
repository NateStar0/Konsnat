# Konsnat!

**Konsnat** is a small, arcade inspired beat 'em up made to scratch my creative itch! Intended the HTML5 platform and built in GameMaker, this project swiftly demonstrates my changing programming styles and intentions as I revisist the project over a number of periods between early 2022 and late 2023, while also highlighting my continued procrastination involving refing procedural generation, and artistic production.

# Assets and Structure
All assets are organised as expected within a typical GameMaker project, please note that assets are assigned a UUID which does not correspond to their sprite, creating difficulty when attempting to search for the asset.

Most assets of this prohect utilise the [GoldGB]() palette with the addition of **#ffffff** and **#000000**

Enjoy :D
